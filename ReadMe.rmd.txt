Files:
	Transfer_Webscraping.ipynb: This is a jupyter notebook file that uses webscraping techniques to get data from Transfermarkt.com
	Transfers.csv: The jupyter notebook file above exports the dataset to this csv file
	fifa_ranking.csv: Monthly data for the national FIFA ranking of every official national soccer team
	Transfers.rmd: An R-markdown file that is used to combine my two datasets and run my analysis
	Executive Summary.docx: This is a brief, high-level overview of my whole project
	FinalPaper.docx: My final research paper, containing my results from the analysis done.		

When viewing and replicating the code, it is important to open and run Transfer_Webscraping.ipynb first to collect the data, and then run Transfers.rmd

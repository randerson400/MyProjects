# MyProjects

This repository is used to store personal projects that I have worked on outside of my required class projects, as well as class projects that I am particularly proud of. Some of the class projects were expanded on upon after their due date out of my own curiosity.

### 1. Fuzzy.Rmd
    This file was used as an exploration on fuzzy learning in R. I had to give a presentation on the topic of fuzzy learning, and in order to understand it better, I found some tutorials online. This tutorial showed how to create a map of countries that showed endangered species level across the globe. The initial map just showed countries in red if a species was endagered there. But, through the use of fuzzy learning, I was able to convert the map that showed how endangered a species was in each country, using a color scale of yellow to red, with red being the most endangered. 
    
### 2. Threading.py
    This code explores the idea of threading in python. Threading allows one computer to run multiple very different processes at the same time. This significantly speeds up run time, and allows for user interfaces to be updated while computations are running in the background. This is just one example, as threading is used in almost all software we use on a daily basis. In this code, it times the same problem using a single process, using multiple processes, and using threading to show how each method has its advantages. In small problems, a single process is actually faster, since it takes time to create a thread or an additional process.

# MyProjects

This repository is used to store personal projects that I have worked on outside of my required class projects, as well as class projects that I am particularly proud of. Some of the class projects were expanded on upon after their due date out of my own curiosity.

### 1. Fuzzy.Rmd
    
This file was used as an exploration on fuzzy learning in R. I had to give a presentation on the topic of fuzzy learning, and in order to understand it better, I found some tutorials online. This tutorial showed how to create a map of countries that showed endangered species level across the globe. The initial map just showed countries in red if a species was endagered there. But, through the use of fuzzy learning, I was able to convert the map that showed how endangered a species was in each country, using a color scale of yellow to red, with red being the most endangered.

The tutorial that I followed for this code was created by A. Marcia Barbosa. 
    
### 2. Threading.py
    
This code explores the idea of threading in python. Threading allows one computer to run multiple very different processes at the same time. This significantly speeds up run time, and allows for user interfaces to be updated while computations are running in the background. This is just one example, as threading is used in almost all software we use on a daily basis. In this code, it times the same problem using a single process, using multiple processes, and using threading to show how each method has its advantages. In small problems, a single process is actually faster, since it takes time to create a thread or an additional process. 

This was created by Dr. Jamie Kelley, and further explored by Ryan Anderson.
    
### 3. Hash Tables

This directory includes all files that are necessary to implement a dictionary using a hassh table. This dictionary is then tested using movies to fill the dictionary. Hash tables are used to search through a dictionary very efficiently. The hash function calculates a psuedorandom position for the movie based on its title. This allows the dictionary to access a movie in near constant time. 

I wrote this project in collaboration with Brett Weicht.
